# The React web app functionality can be summarized as follows:


1. Login and Logout: Users can authenticate themselves using email and password through Firebase Auth. They can securely log in and log out of the application.

2. Add to Cart: Users can add products to their cart for purchasing. The app will maintain a shopping cart functionality, allowing users to manage their selected items.

3. Firebase Auth: The web app utilizes Firebase Authentication to handle user authentication, providing a secure and reliable authentication system.

4. Password and Email: Users can register with their email and password to create an account. They can reset their password if needed through Firebase's built-in password reset functionality.

5. Admin Dashboard: The web app includes an admin dashboard for authorized users. Admins can manage products, inventory, and user data, providing administrative capabilities to handle the eCommerce operations.

6. Firebase Database: Firebase's Realtime Database is used as the backend database to store and retrieve data related to products, orders, and user information. It ensures real-time synchronization and efficient data handling.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
